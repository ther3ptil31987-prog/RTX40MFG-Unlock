# Building v1.4.1-hotfix.1

The v1.4.1-hotfix.1 release uses the V1.4.1 runtime with the merged dev.45
ReShade/RenoDX hair, save-load hair, and session logging fixes. ProductVersion
is 1.4.1-hotfix.1 and FileVersion is 1.4.1.45. The newer RTX 30 development
work is excluded from this release.

The release target is `RTXMFGUnified`, producing `Release/RTXMFG.dll`.
Use Windows x64, Visual Studio 2022/MSVC 14.38.33130, Windows SDK
10.0.22621.0, CMake 4.3.3, and Python 3.10 or newer.

Required external inputs:

- Streamline SDK **2.14.1**, as used by this release.
- Dear ImGui revision `3912b3d9a9c1b3f17431aebafd86d2f40ee6e59c`
  from ReShade 6.8.0, including its backends.
- Vulkan SDK 1.2.176.1 headers and `glslangValidator.exe`.
- The validated SM86 kernel cache, with this directory layout:

```text
native-cache/ampere_native_manifest.inc
native-cache/manifest.json
native-cache/RTX30MFG-Kernels/*.fatbin
native-cache-3109/ampere_native_manifest.inc
native-cache-3109/manifest.json
native-cache-3109/RTX30MFG-Kernels/*.fatbin
all-provider-layouts/native-cache-complete/ampere_native_manifest_additional.inc
all-provider-layouts/native-cache-complete/additional-resources.json
all-provider-layouts/native-cache-complete/RTX30MFG-Kernels/*.fatbin
```

Kernel caches are separately prepared build inputs and are not included in this
source tree. A source checkout alone cannot reproduce the DLL without them.
The build script pins the tools, SDK headers and manifests by SHA-256; CMake
also verifies every embedded kernel's size and hash. No provider DLL is modified.

With those inputs available, run from the repository root, supplying their
actual paths and a fresh build directory:

```powershell
./source/native/build.ps1 `
    -StreamlineRoot 'C:/SDKs/streamline-sdk-v2.14.1' `
    -ImGuiRoot 'C:/SDKs/reshade-6.8.0/deps/imgui' `
    -NativeCacheRoot 'C:/BuildInputs/rtxmfg-sm86' `
    -BuildDirectory "$PWD/build/v1.4.1-hotfix.1" `
    -EnableNgxCreateResultDiagnostics
```

This reproduces the release configuration: the built-in menu and bounded hook
installation are enabled, with the existing bounded NGX Create result log.
GPU fault capture, menu suppression, skipped GPU work and test fault injection
remain disabled. Do not enable those diagnostic switches for a release build.

The proxy dispatchers, Vulkan shader arrays and adapted ImGui DX12 backend are
generated in the build directory. Their normalized SHA-256 values must match
`source/native/generated_sha256.json`. The fixed export map is recorded in
`proxy_exports.txt`; generation does not scan DLLs on the build machine.
Third-party notices remain embedded in the release DLL.

The Witcher 3 hair converter header is generated from
`source/native/witcher_dots/converter.hlsl` and `converter_source.h.in`.
Generated headers and runtime shader caches are not source inputs to publish.

The focused font/publication checks are in `tests/ampere_font`. Configure that
project separately with `MFG_PROVIDER_FIXTURE` pointing to the audited 310.9.1
provider and `MFG_FONT_PROVIDER_LIST` pointing to a text list of audited provider
paths, then build Release and run CTest. These checks use data-only provider
images and mock CUDA calls. They do not establish live provider execution or
correct final presentation in a game.

Menu, loader, control, NVIDIA policy and provider gate regression harnesses are
in [tests/release_regression](tests/release_regression/README.md). They must load
the freshly built DLL. The Vulkan cases use a real Vulkan device; DirectX 12
presentation cases use WARP. They exercise synthetic presentation and control
paths, not a game's Frame Generation output.
